## Project information

### [TP2 - NURBS, Shaders and Animations](tp2)
  - We implemented and modified some objects of the scene with NURBS: rooftops, floor, roads, pillars, etc. We also used shaders to make an effect of pulse on some objects of the scene. With animations, we made a train moving around the city. Also made some visual changes on scene to make it more immersive like adding a background. Lastly we fixed bugs of updating textures and added lights options.
  - Here are some screenshots of the scene:
